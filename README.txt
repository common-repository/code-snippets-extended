Powerful plugin, that allows you to create code snippets & embed it into posts or pages easily.

== Description ==

Using this plugin, you can create code chunks(or snippets) and use them in posts or pages on your site.  

In one snippet you can use different code types: js, php, css, just set required tags.

*  `<?php ?>` - for php code,
*  `<script></script>`, - for js code,
*  `<style></style>` - for stylesheets.

Also you can test snippet code, before save it.
If you want to add your custom language support - write me email. We will translate this plugin together.
